# README #

This is an implementation to solve the Minimum Fill In problem, done in the context of the PACE 2017 challenge
https://pacechallenge.wordpress.com/pace-2017/track-b-minimum-fill-in/

A description of the algorithm used can be found in the document [description.pdf](description.pdf).

To program wait for a description of the graph in stdin in the form "one line = one edge" where an edge is the two ids of each node.
It gives in output the solution, i.e. the edges to remove to make the graph chordal.

Typical use: cat instance.graph | python main.py

Requirements:
Networkx

It also uses some part of the PADS library of D. Eppstein http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/PADS/
